But this is no handout—it’s hardcore education and our mission since 2004. We took our training online in 2008 because serious professionals want to train when and where they want and at their own pace. At the start of 2013, we had 400 courses, authored by 200 of the industry’s top experts. That year, we acquired three companies, PeepCode, TrainSignal and Tekpub, to broaden our library with high-quality open source and IT admin courses. Today, we’ve grown to more than 450,000 subscribers, 500 authors (including Lisa Larsen-Kelley) and 3,000 courses (and counting).</p> </div></li><li class=sponsor_listing><a href="//www.kitchensurfing.com"><img src="/assets/images/sponsors/ks-a7080dfd.jpg"/></a><div class=content><h2><a href="//www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchen Surfing</a></h2><h4>Bronze</h4> </div></li><li class=sponsor_listing><a href="//www.sungard.com/consulting"><img src="/assets/images/sponsors/sungard-57681937.jpg"/></a><div class=content><h2><a href="//www.sungard.com/consulting">Sungard</a></h2><h4>Bronze</h4><p>SunGard Consulting Services helps financial services, energy and media companies solve business problems by managing their complex technology and operational needs.
