title: Great Caching Disasters!
description: Whenever something has gone seriously wrong for me in production caching has been at the root of it. Live Q&A with Julian Assange almost brought the site down? Caching fail. Servers can't cope with traffic about a new woolly rat? Caching fail. Half the site is showing sorry pages? Caching fail. This talk will use these disasters to explain why the simplest caching is always the best.
