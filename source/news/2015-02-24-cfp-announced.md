### GORUCO is now accepting talk proposals through Tuesday, March 24th, 2015!

You can submit here:

### Topics: If You're Interested, We're Interested

Weâ€™re interested in talks on Ruby, but as the NYC Ruby community has grown and matured, our mission has expanded to include anything of interest to the modern development community.

Accepted topics from last year included Raspberry Pi, CS theory, Community development, JS MVC frameworks, Human memory hacks, and even COBOL. We'd love to see proposals on Golang, Clojure, DevOps, Docker, or whatever else is on your mind.


### Talk Formats

This year we will again be accepting talk formats of both 10 and 30 minutes.

All speakers will receive free attendance to the event. In addition, we offer an honorarium and travel reimbursement for those speakers selected for a full-length talk.


### Local Speaker Slots

GORUCO believes in highlighting local talent. We reserve at least two slots for local speakers. Individual talks and panels will be considered local if at least half of the participants are from the tri-state region - that is, within typical commuting distance of Manhattan. In the past, these slots have been less competitive than the other talk slots, so if you live in the tri-state region we strongly urge you to submit a proposal.
