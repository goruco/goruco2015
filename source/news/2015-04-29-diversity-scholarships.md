title: GORUCO Diversity Scholarship Program
author: Elle Meredith 
---

GORUCO’s diversity schol­ar­ship program aims to support traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized persons in the Ruby community (including, but not limited to persons identifying as women, persons of color, LGBT, and/or persons with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend the conference for financial reasons.


Equal access and diversity are important to us, and we aim to remove this obstacle for underrepresented attendee groups. We want you at the conference, and we want to help you get there.

### Award

Scholarship recipients will receive a GORUCO 2015 ticket free of charge. Travel assistance is not included.

### Eligibility

We’re especially interested in applicants who are traditionally underrepresented in the Ruby and greater tech communities, and are unable to attend without some financial assistance.

### Applying

Please submit your scholarship application [here](https://goruco.wufoo.com/forms/goruco-scholarship-application-2015/) by Friday, May 15 at 10:00am EST.

Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact and will be awarded based on review by a selection committee consisting of a subset of GORUCO’s organisers.

All applicants will be notified of their application's status by Friday, May 22.
