In our nine years, we've never received more talk proposals than we got this year. Thank you to everyone who took the time to submit!


### What's Next?

Details about ticket sales will be announced in the next day or so.

The selection committee is meeting later this week, and we'll contact
accepted speakers the week of March 29th. We expect to announce
confirmed speakers the following week, April 5th.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any
questions. See you in June!
