###Talk Synopsis
For the last two years, I've been growing the Ember.js community in NYC from nearly nothing to a vibrant group. Most of what works well for me are things that I learned from getting my sea legs in the Ruby community, so what better place to share than GORUCO?

In this talk, we'll cover the keys to fostering a strong local community, and why it's worth doing. From simple hacks to simple human truths, this talk aims to be pragmatic for tech community organizers and inspire everyone to get involved.
