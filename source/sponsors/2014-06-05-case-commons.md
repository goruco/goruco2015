Case Commons' mission is to transform public sector human services through user-centered design & technology. We're pursuing this vision through the development of Casebook - the first collaborative, family-centered case management system for child welfare, enabling workers serving the most vulnerable families and children to be more effective and efficient via new web-based software tools.
