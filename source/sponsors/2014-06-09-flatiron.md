Flatiron School runs technical training in NYC designed to give great people the skills they need to do great things.

Our core programs are full-time, and focused on Web Development and iOS, but we've also done everything from corporate training to teaching high school kids. We've also partnered with NYC to provide free training to underrepresented groups in the tech community via the NYC Web Development Fellowship.

We bring together incredible people with backgrounds ranging from investment bankers and spinal surgeons to Major League Baseball players, cartoonists and sky-diving instructors, who are passionate about technology. Our graduates are now working at startups like Etsy, Makerbot, Artsy, Handybook and Venmo, and larger companies like Boeing and The New York Times.
